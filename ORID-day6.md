# R
Feeling novel
- Be surprised by my partner‘s magical idea in pairing programming several times. Makes me want to learn more from others.
- Http & Rest API learning makes me gain new insights by studying the past,  like the difference between put & post (idempotent & safe)

# I
- Pairing Programming, a brand-new development model for me, completely subverted my previous habits and action. I think I may need more time and practice to adapt it.

# D
- Follow REST when designing and implementing interfaces, pay attention to the design of resources and paths.
